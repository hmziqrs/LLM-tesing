# TanStack Start v1.0 Project Plan – Pocket Budget Buddy

## 1. Product Goal
- Build a consumer-friendly personal finance web app that helps individuals track spending, organize budgets by category, and visualize cashflow trends.
- Pair a sleek, dark-first interface with deterministic budgeting tools—no AI or opaque automation.
- Provide confidence through transparent data handling, typed APIs, and dependable monitoring.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: TanStack Start v1.0 serving the user interface with React, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and server loaders/actions for auth-aware routing (see `docs/tanstack-start.md`).
- **Backend API**: Dedicated Hono.js service exposing an ORPC (Open-RPC) endpoint surface for type-safe client calls; deployable alongside the frontend or separately (see `docs/hono-backend.md` and `docs/orpc.md`).
- **Shared Types**: Generate ORPC client from backend schemas and share via a common `packages/contracts` workspace to ensure end-to-end type safety (see `docs/orpc.md`).

## 3. Tech Stack & Foundations
- **Runtime**: Bun/Node for both TanStack Start SSR and Hono API workers (see `docs/tanstack-start.md`).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL as the default in all environments (Docker Compose locally, managed Postgres in staging/prod) using Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit migrations shared between services (see `docs/postgresql.md` and `docs/drizzle.md`).
- **Auth**: better-auth with email/password and passkey support; session tokens stored in Postgres; TanStack Start loaders enforce auth while Hono exposes protected ORPC procedures (see `docs/better-auth.md`).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS dark-first theme restricted to `#000`, `#fff`, and opacity-driven grays. Custom `.border-variant` utility provides consistent outlines. Light mode toggle available via header switch.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server data (ORPC hooks) and Zustand for ephemeral UI state (theme toggle, dialogs).
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Pino for structured logs across frontend server and Hono API; Kuma (Uptime Kuma) for external uptime monitoring with health check endpoints (see `docs/pino.md` and `docs/uptime-kuma.md`).
- **File Handling**: CSV uploads for transaction imports processed via Hono API, stored temporarily in object storage (local disk in dev) prior to parsing.
- **Tooling & Testing**: TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Testing Library, MSW, and Playwright powered via pnpm scripts. Husky pre-commit hooks. GitHub Actions CI across lint, type-check, unit, integration, and e2e smoke suites.
